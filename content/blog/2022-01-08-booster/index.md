### Study title

Safety and immunogenicity of seven COVID-19 vaccines as a third dose (booster) following two doses of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 or BNT162b2 in the UK (COV-BOOST): a blinded, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial-Lancet 2021; 398: 2258–76.

Published Online December 2, 2021

## Vaccines tested:
Pfizer–BioNtech, Oxford– AstraZeneca, Moderna,Novavax, Janssen, CureVac and Valneva

## Outcomes studied

+ Immunogenicity outcome was anti-spike protein IgG at day 28 follow-up
+ Neutralising antibody titres against wild-type (ie, the original strain identified in Wuhan) and T-cell response against wild-type and SARS-CoV-2 virus variants of concern: alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), and delta.

## Added value of this study

+ The first randomised trial of third dose booster vaccines given 10–12 weeks after an initial course of **Oxford– AstraZeneca or Pfizer–BioNtech COVID-19 immunisation**. 
+ This trial has demonstrated the potential of **all vaccines tested**  to **boost immunity after an initial course of Oxford– AstraZeneca or Pfizer–BioNtech**. 
+ All vaccines showed acceptable side-effect profiles.

## Limitation

+ Immunogenisity against Omicron variant of COVID19 not tested.
