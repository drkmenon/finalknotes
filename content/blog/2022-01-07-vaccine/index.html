<p>I am fortunate enough to receive the COVID19 vaccine on 23/1/21. Here I am sharing a great vaccination experience I had and I will be regularly updating the document, watching for any vaccine related adverse reactions and potential period of immunity.</p>

<h2>What is Covishield?</h2>
<p>Since the announcement of vaccination program from Jan 16<sup>th</sup> 2021, I felt amazement at the scientific accomplishment.</p>
<p>I understand that the AZD1222 (Covishield) vaccine is a replication-deficient simian adenovirus vector, containing the full‐length codon‐optimized coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein <mark>along with a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader sequence</mark>. After vaccination, this spike protein is produced, promoting the immune system to attack the coronavirus if it later infects the body.</p>
<p>I look at this astounding achievement as pure magic.</p>

<h2>Vaccination day</h2>
<p>Today was the day I got the 1st dose of COVID vaccine at the Amala Institute of Medical Sciences Vaccination center.</p>
<p>As I walked to the facility, I was filled with excitement and anxiety. The weight of all these months — staying away from loved ones, taking care of patients, conducting online and offline classes, carrying out covid duties, coupled with the tension-filled job of trying to keep me and my loved ones safe — everything surfaced in me. I wondered, how would I react to the vaccine?</p>
<p>From the moment I got in, to the moment I walked away, I was impressed by the efficiency, the courtesy, the enthusiasm, and the professionalism of the Amala staff assigned to this task. Each step along the way was smooth and well-coordinated, which allowed me to relax and enjoy the experience. The watchman enthusiastically helped me to take some photographs in front of the vaccination center.</p>
<p>I could not have asked for a better experience of getting vaccinated. Hats off to the Community medicine department (especially Dr Jose Vincent), Amala Management and the Health department for being so well-organized and professional. We have much to be proud of.</p>
<p>In the end, I felt a flood of relief and gratitude that vaccines are becoming available less than a year after we recognized there was a novel coronavirus. I thankfully remember the unknown minds and hands behind this incredible feat.</p>
