<p>Assume that we have a normally distributed population of males and females with a mean height of 168cms and 158cms respectively.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
set.seed(1)
m=rnorm(100,168,5)
f=rnorm(100,158,5)
mf=data.frame(m,f)</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] 10.7</code></pre>
<p>We can see that the mean difference in the height is 10.7 cms.<br />
<strong>If I measure the entire population in the world, will I find that the mean height for each sex is different?</strong> or<br />
<strong>would I find that difference between the mean height is zero?</strong></p>

<h2>How to answer this question?</h2>
<div id="frequentist-method" class="section level3">
<h3>Frequentist method</h3>
<p>Assume a hypothetical world with no difference in the height between the sexes.Do repeated experiments and find out what <code>proportion of times</code> would I obtain a difference between the observed means(ø) in that hypothetical world which is as great as or greater than difference I observed in my real experiment.
<strong>This proportion of time is abbreviated as <em>p-value</em> </strong></p>
<p>In other words <em>p-value</em>=P(ø/H), given the null(H), what is the probability of data(ø)</p>
<p>but <em>p-value</em> is an answer to a question we didn’t intend to ask. So what to do with it?</p>

<h2>Fisher:</h2>
<p>Treat it as a measure of strength of evidence. This is not objectively satisfactory because, <em>p-value</em>=P(ø/H)≠P(H/ø)</p>

<div id="neyman-pearson-decision-framework" class="section level2">
<h2>Neyman-Pearson decision framework</h2>
<p>In each experiment, if you need to choose between the Null and the alternative, then there is possibility for two types of errors</p>
<p>False Positive: Choosing the alternative when Null is true</p>
<p>False Negative: Choosing the Null when the alternative is true</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Control the rate at which you commit decision errors of false positive type by applying a strict procedure to each experiment:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The researcher has to make a decision</strong>. In research, convention is to reject null hypothesis if the test result is outside the 95% mark in the normal curve. The remaining 5% is called <code>œ</code>. The boundary is approximately <code>1.96z</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>œ</code> is the zone of rejection of null hypothesis and <code>z</code> the boundary between the acceptance and rejection zones of null hypothesis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we refer the statistical charts, p value for a <code>z</code> score of 1.96 is ≤0.05</p>
<div id="so-the-decision-framework-is-to" class="section level3">
<h3>So the decision framework is to</h3>
<ul>
<li>Compute <em>p-value</em></li>
<li>Choose the Null if <em>p-value</em> is &gt; α</li>
<li>Choose the alternative if <em>p-value</em> is &lt;= α</li>
<li>Typically α is set at 0.05</li>
</ul>
<p>Another important concept is <strong>confidence interval</strong></p>

<div id="confidence-interval" class="section level2">
<h2>Confidence Interval</h2>
<p>Under repeated sampling in hypothetical world, 95% of confidence intervals constructed the same way will include the true value of the mean difference.</p>
<p>It ranges between a fixed value x and y on either side of zero,i.e., <code>x-0-y</code>.</p>
<p>0-x is the lower confidence limit and 0+y is the upper confidence limit.</p>
<div id="confidence-limit" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Confidence limit</strong></h3>
<p>This sets the boundary of confidence interval and it is generally taken as 95%.</p>
<p>confidence interval is generally considered as more important than p value because it gives</p>

<li>Statistical significance</li>
<li>Clinical significance</li>
<li>Precision</li>
